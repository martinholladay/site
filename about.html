        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
           I am learning HTML and CSS at City University and as part of this, I've constructed this simple site. 
		   I have never really spent any time using HTML and CSS, so this was a great learning experience and 
		   it seems I've learned enought that if I wanted to build more complex sites, I'd feel pretty comfortable 
		   doing so.
        </p>
		<p>
			Beyond this class, I work for Salesforce.com in Seattle as a Quality Engineering Manager and all I 
			can say about this is <b>#dreamjob</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prior to Salesforce.com, I spend a few years working in Start Ups that all seemed to Shut Down. I think 
			the appeal of being part of a Start Up was stronger than the reality.  In reality Start Ups are TOUGH - Fun 
			but tough.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the above, I also spent 15 years working for Microsoft in Redmond. This was a great 
			experience that prepared me well for anything Software Development Related that I wanted to do.  As I 
			look back, it is amazing how much I learned while working for Microsoft - all of which has made me an 
			exceptional Manager and Engineer.
