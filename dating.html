        <h1>Dating Site Reviews</h1>
        <h2>Cycling Passions</h2>
		<p>
            Cycling Passions is perhaps one of my favorite dating sites and that is because 
			it links two markets into one social site - Cycling and Dating.
        </p>
		<p>
            It was a little confusing, as its header includes a lot of advertisements, I click on 
			Browse Singles Now and ended up at a Filipinos Singles Site.  After hitting the back 
			button, I realized that I had clicked on an Ad. The site advertises to be free, which 
			is likely true as there are ads everywhere to the point that it makes navigation 
			somewhat confusing.
        </p>	
		<p>
			In creating an account, I ended up on an entirely different dating site, Looxy.com, 
			which looked pretty suspect to me. To actually start chatting with folks, I'd need 
			a Paid Subscription. Thus draw me in and get my money. Pretty much the same old story 
			of most dating site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although I would not recommend <a href="http://www.cyclingpassions.com/">Cycling Passions</a>
			 I'm including the link for completeness.
		</p>
        <h2>Looxy</h2>
		<p>
            Since I was tricked into joining the site, I figured why not review it. The f irst thing to 
			point out is that the site is filled with links to other pages or scripts to the point I'm 
			essentially scared for the safety of my computer.  But hey as a determined journalist, I 
			must venture on.
		<p>
			The site starts out with a typical carousel of photos that you can like or skip.  The top 
			banner shows that a couple women have messaged me, which I find surprising since I've only been on 
			the site for a few minutes, but nonetheless, I take the bait and click there.  I find that a couple 
			of women have messaged me and I have the option to submit a cureated message for a list box back to 
			them.  As I click on other links like Visitors, Likes You & Matches, I'm prompted to buy a 
			subscription.
        </p>
		<p>
			All in all the site looks like a total scan and has a low trust rating from  
			<a href="http://www.scamadviser.com/is-looxy.com-safe.html">Scam Advisors</a>.  Thus stay far far away.	
		</p>
		<h2>Date Hookup</h2>
		<p>
            Date Hookup advertises itself as a totally free dating site.  After giving it very little demographic 
			information, it shows a grid of profiles.  After clicking on a profile and attempting to communicate 
			using meet me free option.  This took me to a usename, password, email form and after completing that 
			I was provided numerous pages asking all kinds of Dating Profile questions. As I look up, I see that I am 
			actually on Match.Com!
        </p>
		<p>
			Seems Date Hookup just sends you over to Match.com.  
		<p>
			Not my cup of tea but why not take a look at <a href="http://www.datehookup.com/">Date Hookup</a>
