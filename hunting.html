        <h1>Hunting Site Reviews</h1>
        <p>
          Social Sites related to Hunting tend to be political in nature and often call out
		  groups that they believe are against them such as PETA, People for the Ethical 
		  Treatment of Animals.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <b><i>DISCLAIMER: </b></i> I personally am not taking sides for or against any groups
		  that these reviews call out. I am simply providing site reviews.
        </p>

		<h2>See  Me Hunt</h2>
		<p>
            See Me Hunt is working to be Facebook for Hunters. In order to access the site an 
			account is required.  The account requires demographic information and asks some 
			questions pertaining to your hunting preferences. 
			After signing in you get a three panel display with the center panel being a traditinal
			Feed showing posts from other users.  You can comment, like and share the posts or you can 
			create a post of your own. The panel to the right has links which allow you to browse the 
			network, invite your friends update your profile and other features.
        </p>
		<p>
			In general the site seems pretty complete so why not check them out <a href="http://www.seemehunt.com/">See Me Hunt</a>
		</p>	
		<h2>Hunt Trophy</h2>
		<p>
           Much like See Me Hunt, Hunt Trophy requires you to create an account to access their content.  
		   They have forums for meeting other hunters, posting about your trips and searching for 
		   upcoming events and contest.  Seems like a very complete and usable site.
        </p>
		<p>
			They support a global community, so why not check them out <a href="http://en.hunttrophy.com/">Hunt Trophy</a>
		</p>		
        <h2>Hunters Against PETA</h2>
		<p>
            Hunters Against PETA.com has approximately 12,000 registered hunters on their site. 
			They ask for donations to help protect their hunting rights.  While they don't have 
			groups like other Social Site, they do have discussion forums. The forum is copyrighted 
			by Simple:Press and looks like forums that I've seen on other sites.
        </p>
		<p>
			This sites mission it to help protect hunter's rights and includes hunting news, a list 
			of sponsors, forums as mentioned earlier and hunting apparel for sale.  All in all, it 
			seems like a well laid out site.
		<p>
			Please check them out <a href="http://www.huntersagainstpeta.com/">Hunters Against PETA</a>
		</p>

        <h2>National Wildlife Federation</h2>
		<p>
            While the National Wildlife Federation is not a Social Network in the traditional 
			sense, it does provide a lot of content for Hunters.  They do have a Blog section which 
			allows you to register to follow various blogs.
        </p>
